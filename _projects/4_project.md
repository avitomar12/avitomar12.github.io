Developed a complete anomaly detection pipeline to monitor hardware vibrations using **50 sensor nodes** integrated with Raspberry Pi for data collection and transmission.

- Designed and deployed **REST APIs** to transfer sensor data from Raspberry Pi to AWS Cloud.
- Built and trained machine learning models (**Isolation Forest, Random Forest, Autoencoder**) to detect real-time anomalies with up to **93.7% accuracy**.
- Developed a real-time **dashboard** for visualizing sensor data and anomaly alerts.
- Deployed the entire solution on AWS Cloud ensuring scalability, reliability, and efficient data stream handling.
