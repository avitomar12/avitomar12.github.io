Developed and implemented two unique algorithms for the graph burning problem, advancing the state of the art in parameterized complexity.

- **Treewidth + Burning Number**: Designed an algorithm using treewidth and burning number as parameters, contributing novel insights to graph burning literature.
- **Distance to Threshold Graph**: Improved an existing algorithm by reducing its computational complexity from double exponential to single exponential.

This work was published in the **34th International Workshop on Combinatorial Algorithms (IWOCA 2023), Taiwan**.
