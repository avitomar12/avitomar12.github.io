## Welcome to My Personal Website!

I am currently pursuing a **PhD at the Department of Informatics and Applied Informatics** at [Vrije Universiteit Brussel](https://www.vub.be/) under the supervision of **Prof. Bas Ketsman**. My research focuses on **scalable data systems**, **query optimization**, **graph theory**, and **algorithms**.

Beyond my academic work, I am an avid learner with a deep interest in emerging technologies. I also enjoy outdoor activities such as **hiking, running, and swimming**, which bring balance to my life and often inspire my approach to problem-solving and innovation.

I’m always happy to discuss my research and publications. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, feel free to **reach out**!

Fun fact: My **Erdős number is 3**.
