As a Research Assistant at the University of Twente, my work revolves around crafting optimization algorithms for energy management systems. My academic journey, including a MS by Research in Graph theory and Parameterized algorithms and a MSc in Computer Science, has equipped me with a robust foundation in data analysis and software development.

Outside of work, I enjoy running, swimming, and cycling, and I hope to complete a triathlon one day. I’m always curious and love exploring new technologies and new ideas.

To fuel my creativity I write poetry and article. Find them on Medium.

My Erdős number is 3.
